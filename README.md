**Did we already cross Earth’s boundaries without realising it?**

This repository contains the code, data processing steps, and visualizations 
used to explore whether early‑warning signals of accelerated warming appear around ~1.2 °C.

**Contents:**

**report.pdf**

A full narrative report containing my findings, figures, and interpretation.
You can view it directly on GitHub or download it to ensure all links work properly.

**Model.R**

The R script used to load the datasets, run the model, and generate the diagnostic plots.
Written in RStudio using the following libraries:

lubridate  
ggplot2  
ggthemes  
dplyr  
readr  
patchwork  
tidyr

**/report/markdown-report.html**

An HTML version of the analysis, generated via R Markdown.
It explains the code structure and modelling steps in more detail.

**Purpose of this project**

This project investigates three independent diagnostics related to global warming:

• 	the CO₂–temperature relationship

• 	the decline of natural CO₂ uptake

• 	the separation of fast and slow temperature components

Surprisingly, all three diagnostics converge around ~1.2 °C — raising 
the question whether critical thresholds may be reached earlier than the commonly 
cited 1.5–2.0 °C.
